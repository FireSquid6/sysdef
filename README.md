# sysdef
A declarative experience for any package manager.

# Installation


# Usage
Sysdef expects a workspace directory to store a multi-file config. It uses `yaml`.

# Repo
The repo contains the following directories:
- `package` - the core package for sysdef. Everything in the `src` directory is actually copied over into your installation of sysdef 
- `example-workspace` - an example workspace to toy around with for development
- `providers` - the providers directory for every provider. If you make your own provider, put it here!
