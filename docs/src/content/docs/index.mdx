# Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Hackable" icon="pencil">
    A sysdef installation includes its own source code. Want to add your own feature or minor tweak? Just open the source code and make your change.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Programmatically Configured" icon="setting">
    Sysdef is configured in typescript. This means you don't have to learn some esoteric DSL and aren't restricted to just a schema like YAML.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Platform Agnostic" icon="rocket">
    Sysdef can run using any package manager with its system of providers. You could even use the same configuration across multiple distros or operating systems.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Open Source" icon="star">
    Sysdef is FOSS. If you have modifications that you would like to share with everyone, go ahead and make a PR!
