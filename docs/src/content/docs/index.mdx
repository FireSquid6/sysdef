Sysdef is a hackable system configuration tool built in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Bun](https://bun.sh). It allows you to define files, directories, and packages for your system to be installed and managed declaratively. If you've ever wanted the benefits of something like NixOS without being trapped in its ecosystem, sysdef is for you. 

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireSquid6/sysdef/refs/heads/main/scripts/clone-and-initialize.sh | bash
```

# Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Hackable" icon="pencil">
    A sysdef installation includes its own source code. Want to add your own feature or minor tweak? Just open the source code and make your change.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Programmatically Configured" icon="setting">
    Sysdef is configured in typescript. This means you don't have to learn some esoteric DSL and aren't restricted to just a schema like YAML.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Platform Agnostic" icon="rocket">
    Sysdef can run using any package manager with its system of providers. You could even use the same configuration across multiple distros or operating systems.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Open Source" icon="star">
    Sysdef is FOSS. If you have modifications that you would like to share with everyone, go ahead and make a PR!
